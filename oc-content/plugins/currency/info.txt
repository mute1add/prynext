Just install the plugin and you will have the filter in the search sidebar using the search form hook.

If you want to include the selector manual in other area from your search sidebar, just comment this line from index.php:
osc_add_hook('search_form', 'currency_c_selector');

Using this function you can include the selector in another area:
<?php currency_c_selector(); ?>

Make sure that the line is included in the search form.

Enjoy!
